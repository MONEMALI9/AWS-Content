    "(Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.<br> It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks,<br> which allows you to focus on your applications and business.<br> Amazon RDS provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from:<br> Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.\n",

    "3. Open a web application and interact with your database.\n",
