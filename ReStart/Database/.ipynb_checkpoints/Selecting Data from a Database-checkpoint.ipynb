    "## Task 2: Query the world database\n",
    "In this task, you query the world database using various SELECT statements and database operators.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. To show the existing databases, enter the following command in the terminal.<br>\n",
    ">>SHOW DATABASES;<br>\n",
    "Verify that a database named world is available. If the world database is not available, then contact your instructor.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "13. To list all rows and columns in the country table, run the following query.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT * FROM world.country;\n",
    "\n",
    "14. To query the number of rows in a table, you can use the COUNT() function in a SELECT statement.<br> To count all the rows in table, you can use COUNT(*).<br> To count the number of rows that have a value in a specific column, include the column name as a parameter in the COUNT() function: for example, COUNT(Population).<br> To list the number of rows in the country table, run the following query.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world.country;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "15. To list all columns in the country table, run the following query. You run this query to understand the table schema.<br>\n",
    ">>SHOW COLUMNS FROM world.country;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "16. To query specific columns in the world table, run the following query to return a result set that includes the Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, and Population columns.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, Population FROM world.country;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Database column names are sometimes not user friendly. To add a more descriptive column name to the query output, you can use the AS option. Run the following query that includes this option.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS \"Surface Area\", Population FROM world.country;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If required, scroll to the top of the query results, and observe that the SurfaceArea column is displayed as Surface Area.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Ordered result sets are easier to view and work with.<br> If you would like to order the output based on a column, you can use the ORDER BY option.<br> In this example, you order the output based on the population.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS \"Surface Area\", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORDER BY option orders data in ascending order.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "19. To order data in descending order, use the DESC option with ORDER BY. Run the following command with this option.<br> \n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS \"Surface Area\", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population DESC;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "20. You can add conditions to SELECT statements by using the WHERE clause.<br> For example, to list all rows with a population greater than 50,000,000, run the following query.<br>\n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS \"Surface Area\", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000 ORDER BY Population DESC;\n",
    "You have used the > comparison operator. Similarly, you can use other comparison operators to compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. You can construct a WHERE clause by using a number of conditions and operators.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following query uses two conditions: all rows with a population greater than 50,000,000 and all rows with a population less than 100,000,000. The query includes the AND operator to indicate that both the conditions must be true. Run the following query in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS \"Surface Area\", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000 AND Population < 100000000 ORDER BY Population DESC;<br>\n",
    "\n",
